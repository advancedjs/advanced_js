# Mashup

This project is open-ended!  Build a site that uses data from at least one external API in an interesting way.  Start simple!  No server-side coding is required, but feel free to create a backend in whatever language if you like, if you need one.

* [list of API suggestions](https://gist.github.com/afeld/4952991)

Bonus points:

* automated tests
    * [Sinon.js fakeServer](http://sinonjs.org/docs/#fakeServer) may be helpful
* fancy interactivity/animations
