# Text Twist

As homework, you are going to re-create the game Text Twist.  The original (http://zone.msn.com/en/texttwist/, or [gameplay video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEfor-WdWTk&t=0m13s)) is an old-school Flash app... we want to bring it into this decade and port to JavaScript.  Spend a bit of time playing it to get the feel (warning: addictive).  The requirements:

* two sets of letters
    * get a single set working first
    * the dictionaries can be small - just enough to show that the game works
    * should be trivial to add additional sets
* which set is used for each game (random vs. strict ordering): coder’s choice
* letters from set displayed in random order at the start of each game
* game should be playable with keyboard only (you might use jQuery [keypress](http://api.jquery.com/keypress/)/[keydown](http://api.jquery.com/keydown/))
* display a player’s progress within a game, either similar to the Yahoo implementation (empty boxes on the left), or in a different creative way
* a countdown showing the time remaining (time limit up to you)
* a way to reset the game when it ends
* use at least one of the Contructor, Factory or Module patterns
* commented, well-structured code

Bonus points:

* additional sets of letters
* automated tests
* "twist" functionality (reshuffling the letters mid-game)
* animations (using JavaScript or CSS3)
* variations or enhancements to the gameplay (please provide a written explanation of the expected behavior)

You are welcome to publish on the web (think of your own name), but **please email files/folder/.zip of all necessary files to instructor (alf9 [at] nyu [dot] edu) by the start of the final session.**  You will also have the option to demo your game to the class.
